## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a negative correlation between the Loan Original 
Amount and the Borrower Annual Percentage Rate. An increased amount of the Loan Original 
Amount the Borrower APR was less. 
There was a positive correlation between the Stated Monthly Income and the Loan Original 
Amount which was indicated by an increased Monthly income contributed to a Loan original 
amount.<br>
Most of the loans have a duration 36 months and large number of borrower are employed. 
There is a slight interaction on the Prosper Rating. There was an interesting relationship 
between the Borrower Annual Percentage Rate and the Prosper Rating. While the Borrower 
APR increased the prosper rating decreased to a better quality. The Loan Original Amount and 
the loan term increased while the borrower APR decreased.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the loan variables that had an effect on the Borrower 
Annual Percentage Rate. These loan features are the Loan Original Amount, Stated Monthly 
Income and Borrower APR which are all numerical variables. Other categorical features are the 
Loan term, Prosper Rating and the Employment and how these features affect the Borrower 
APR.<br>
Afterwards, plotting the distribution of each feature, I explored the relationship between the 
Numerical and the categorical variables. I then displayed the relationship between the Loan 
Original Amount and the Borrower APR. I have made sure to explore how the employment 
status, Loan terms and the Prosper Rating play into the relationship between the Loan Original 
Amount and the Borrower APR
